# operator

> Docstring:
Operator interface.

> This module exports a set of functions implemented in C corresponding
to the intrinsic operators of Python.  For example, operator.add(x, y)
is equivalent to the expression x+y.  The function names are those
used for special methods; variants without leading and trailing
'__' are also provided for convenience.
